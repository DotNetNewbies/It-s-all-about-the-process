- Leader:
  - Takes responsibility for *everything*, good or bad, especially bad and  
    then ***fixes the bad***.  
  - Take credit for nothing save their own work, praises the individuals that  
    do the actual work publicly. Shows their own supervisors how they are  
    doing an awesome job **because the folks they supervise are awesome**.  
  - Remove roadblocks to progress.
  - Ensure their workers have the necessary information, resources and  
    authority to carry out their assignments. In short, completely empower  
    their people.
  - Pass out public praise where warranted, pass out censure privately as  
    needed.  
  - Listens to all input from their people, acts on the good stuff.  
  - Best attribute of a leader is that you'll never know they are there  
    ***unless you need them for something***, in which case, they always help.  
  - "Excellence" is their watchword.  

- Manager: Complete antithesis of a leader. Despicable individual that thinks  
           they are "in charge" and possesses the following attributes:
  - Take responsibility for *nothing*.
  - Take credit for everything.
  - Place intentional roadblocks in the paths of the folks they supervise in  
    order to show the "incompetence" of their workers to the managers  
    supervisors, aka CYA (Cover Your Ass) syndrome.  
    In other words, set up their people for failure from the beginning.  
  - Make unreasonable demands and then, when the demands are not met, blame  
    the people of whom the impossible demand was made for "not doing their  
    job" and inflict punishment with long-term repercussions for said "failure".
  - Do not empower their people in any fashion as that constitutes a threat  
    to the managers power.
  - Constantly belittles the accomplishments of their team to ensure low  
    morale and a general feeling of worthlessness of each individual.  
  - Takes no advice, does not listen to their people.  
  - "Productivity" is their watchword.  

Please understand, that if I were to walk up to you and tell you that:  
"I think you are a wonderful manager", I have just dealt you the deadliest  
insult I can without actually swearing at you and contemplating hurting you.  

Managing is easy, which is why it's so common, ***leading*** is *hard*, which  
is why it is so uncommon.
