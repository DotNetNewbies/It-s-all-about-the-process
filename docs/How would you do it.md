Ok, this document will be all about how I would approach my job as a senior  
software engineer (which I am).  

<hr>  

Leaders and Managers and the incredibly vast difference between them:

The first order of business, let's define the various job roles that a  
successful development team will require.  

The first implication is that this is a cross-functional team meaning that the  
folks will come from a wide variety of disciplines, each one a full-time  
career, not something one can do for an hour or two a week and be good at.  

The major roles in any good software development team are these:

The following are just two of the myriad job offers I receive every day. These  
jobs are typical in their "required skills", I did not single them out for  
anything save that their job description was a little better than most as they  
contain a bit more detail as to what the job entails.  

Job Role: Senior .NET Developer

- Experience of leading team in all aspects of .NET

- Experience of AGILE methodology

- Must have strong communication skills

- Experience in onshore offshore communication 

- Experience in DOT NET CORE , C#, MVC, jQuery, Javascript

- Adaptable and quick in terms of changing situations.

- Hands on working experience in designing, solutioning and leading distributed  
  technologies like .NET, JavaScript, jQuery, linQ, etc

- Knowledge of Mulesoft API will be a bonus

- Confident and independent                    

- Experienced in SAFE, Scrum AGILE methodologies

- Vast experience in Design and requirement elicitation.

- Experienced .NET resource with Tech Leading experience (MUST)

- Should be experienced of handling offshore team and guide the team from  
  Technical standpoint.

- Communicate issues/risks/status to project stakeholders throughout the  
  engagement 

- Execute various phases of software development life cycle such as analysis,  
  design, technical writing, implementation, testing and deployment            

- Prepare requirement understanding document, test execution and defects  
  management           

- Providing subject matter expertise and technical guidance to the team

- Review Code and Test results of the team.  

### Summary of the "Senior .NET Developer" role:  
- Must be not only a developer, but must be a Team/technical (MUST) Lead  
- Familiar with Agile (which one?) - oh, wait, with SAFE Agile.
- Work with offshore teams (might need to be multi-lingual, certainly will be  
  working odd hours, not the standard 9-5)  
- Must be familiar with the following languages:  
  - C#  
    - ASP.NET's MVC (is that with Blazor or not?)  
  - JQuery (javascript)
  - javascript in general (so I guess no Blazor)  
- Mulesoft? It's an integration platform. So you also need to be:  
  - a Functional programmer (vs OOP)
    - Know the DataWeave language for Mulesoft integrations  
    Which language is used for MuleSoft? From their docs:  
      "DataWeave is a functional language used in Mule applications to perform  
      data transformations. Before you begin to use DataWeave to code your own  
      powerful and complex data transformations, you must understand the basic  
      concepts of programming and the core features of functional programming  
      languages."  
- Not only writing code, must be able to interface with stakeholders concerning  
  risks/status/issues as the project develops. (hint: This is the job of the PM)  
- Manage all phases of the SDLC (wait, what!?):  
  - Analysis (Job of the Business Analyst)
  - Design (Job of the Systems Architect)  
  - Technical writing (Technical document writer)  
  - implementation (NOW I get to write C# code)
  - Testing (Job of the QA specialist)  
  - Deployment (Job of the DevOps folks)  
  - Document all phases of the project (Tech writer again):
    - How to use the application
    - How to test the application
    - How to manage and alleviate defects in the application  
- Be the onsite technical lead to teach and provide guidance to the rest of the  
  team.
- Be the Development Manager to perform code reviews  
- Be the QA manager to perform test reviews.  

In short, the above summary requires that I be an expert in the following:  
- Developer (OOP and Functional, multi-lingual e.g. C#, javascript, DataWeave)  
- Team Lead
- Technical Lead (Systems Architect)  
- Project Manager
- Business Analyst
- Technical writer  
- QA tester
- QA manager
- DevOps engineer
- Cloud specialist (why use SAAS integration if not in the cloud?)

In other words, I just hit ***TEN different, full-time, career-level*** job  
descriptions, each one of which I am to be something of an expert, certainly  
competent to perform.  
As I see it, my so-called "work-life balance" just went out the window for  
multiple reasons (think off-short time zones and emerging "emergencies"), I  
will be *constantly* trying to keep up with 10 different fields of endeavour,  
I must constantly provide training to my peers, etc. etc. etc.  
And all for the lofty salary of...67K. Yep, sixty-seven thousand dollars a year.
